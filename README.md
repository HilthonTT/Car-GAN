## Introduction

The Stanford CAR GAN project aims to generate high-quality images of cars using GANs. This project uses a dataset of car images and trains a GAN model to produce realistic car images.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/HilthonTT/Car-GAN.git
    cd src
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate    # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

## Usage

Open the Jupyter notebook to train and evaluate the model:

1. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

2. **Navigate to the notebooks directory and open `car-gan.ipynb`.**

3. **Run the cells in the notebook to train the GAN model:**
   Follow the instructions in the notebook to train the model. The notebook includes steps for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Examples

Here are some examples of images generated by the GAN model:
